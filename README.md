Snap Jam is an application that I worked on with some classmates at Dev Academy. We went into this projects with the goal of creating a website that allows musicians to record their own tracks, upload those tracks to a project, and allow other musicians to contribute to them. At the moment, it uses SQLite to store data, Multer to handle audio files, and Howler.js to sync multiple audio files together. In the future, I hope to develop an online Digital Audio Workstation to our user experience more streamlined.
